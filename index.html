    <h2>What is web development?</h2>
    <p>A web developer’s job is to create websites. While their primary role is to ensure the website is visually appealing and easy to navigate, many web developers are also responsible for the website’s performance and capacity. </p>

    <h3>Types of web developers</h3>
    <p>Web developers usually fall under one of three categories: back-end developers, front-end developers, and full-stack developers. Some web developers also work as webmasters. Let’s take a closer look at each of these roles.</p>

        A formal education isn’t always necessary to become an entry-level web developer. 
        Some web developers have an associate or bachelor’s degree in website design or computer science, 
        but others teach themselves how to code and design websites. 
        While earning a degree can make you a more competitive candidate, 
        a strong portfolio can go a long way toward validating your skills to potential employers.</p>

    <h2>How much do web developers make</h2>
    <p>
        The median annual salary for web developers in the US is $78,300, 
        according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) [1]. However, 
        web developers in the US can earn up to $249,297 according to Glassdoor salary insights [2]. 
        How much you earn will depend on many factors, including where you work, what industry you work in, 
        and how much experience you have.

        BLS estimates 23 percent industry growth for web developers between 2021-2031, 
        a faster-than-average rate compared to other occupations. One of the driving forces 
        behind this increase in web development jobs is the growth of e-commerce. Companies 
        are becoming more reliant on functioning websites that operate on multiple devices to do business.</p>
